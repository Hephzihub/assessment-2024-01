# Longest Zigzag Path in a Binary Tree

The solution involves recursively traversing the binary tree and keeping track of the direction of the previous step (left or right) and the current length of the zigzag path. The main function `solution(T)` initializes the process, and the helper function `longestZigZag` performs the recursive traversal. Let's break down how it works.

## Main Function: `solution(T)`

The `solution` function is the entry point of the algorithm. It first checks if the input tree `T` is null. If it is, the function returns 0, indicating there is no zigzag path. If the tree is not null, it calls the helper function `longestZigZag` with the root node `T`, an initial position "N" (Neutral), and a count of 0.

## Helper Function: `longestZigZag(node, pos, count)`

The `longestZigZag` function is a recursive helper function designed to calculate the longest zigzag path in the binary tree. It takes three parameters:
- `node`: the current node
- `pos`: the position indicating the direction from the parent node, which can be "L" for left, "R" for right, or "N" for neutral
- `count`: the current length of the zigzag path

Within the `longestZigZag` function, the variable `max` is initialized to the current `count`. The function then checks if the left child (`node.l`) exists. If it does, it initializes a new count `newCount` to the current `count`. If the current position `pos` is "R" (indicating the previous step was to the right), it increments `newCount` by 1, as this step to the left continues the zigzag pattern. The function then recursively calls itself with the left child, position "L", and the updated count, updating `max` with the maximum value returned.

Similarly, the function checks if the right child (`node.r`) exists. If it does, it initializes `newCount` to the current `count`. If the current position `pos` is "L" (indicating the previous step was to the left), it increments `newCount` by 1, as this step to the right continues the zigzag pattern. The function then recursively calls itself with the right child, position "R", and the updated count, updating `max` with the maximum value returned.

Finally, the function returns `max`, which represents the length of the longest zigzag path found in the subtree rooted at the current node. This recursive approach ensures that all possible zigzag paths are explored, and the longest one is identified.

## The Approach

The approach uses a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to traverse the binary tree while keeping track of the direction and length of the zigzag path. By recursively exploring both left and right children and updating the path length based on the direction, the solution efficiently finds the longest zigzag path in the tree.
